# OOP

Just uploaded my work from the past few days.  
Starting with learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. 

This repository contains various beginner exercises and projects in Java as I explore OOP principles, including classes, objects, constructors, and basic control structures.

## Projects

- **Petlje**: Practicing loops in Java.
- **Automobil**: Basic class structure, constructors, and methods.
- **Kino & Film project.

Stay tuned for more updates as I progress!
