# üßë‚Äçüíª Java Practice Repository

This repository contains various Java practice exercises focusing on core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The projects and exercises included here are designed to help reinforce understanding of OOP concepts such as loops, collections, inheritance, classes, data validation, and practical application of these principles in Java.

## Overview of Projects and Exercises

### 1. Loops (Petlje)
- **Description**: Practice tasks involving different types of loops in Java, including `for`, `while`, `do-while`, and `for-each` loops.
- **Goal**: Strengthen understanding of loop structures and their use cases in solving iterative problems.

### 2. ArrayList
- **Description**: Exercises focusing on the use of `ArrayList` for managing collections of objects and data.
- **Goal**: Develop familiarity with Java‚Äôs `ArrayList` class, including adding, removing, iterating over elements, and applying conditions to filter data.

### 3. Inheritance (Nasljeƒëivanje)
- **Description**: Examples and exercises demonstrating inheritance in Java, showcasing the use of parent and child classes, method overriding, and polymorphism.
- **Goal**: Understand the principles of inheritance, enabling the creation of more maintainable and scalable code through class hierarchies.

### 4. Data Validation and Handling
- **Description**: Tasks involving the validation of user input and handling data to ensure robustness in Java programs.
- **Goal**: Implement techniques for checking and managing input data, ensuring programs can handle various scenarios and edge cases safely.

### 5. Class Structures and Object Manipulation
- **Description**: Exercises focusing on creating classes with attributes and methods, including constructors and custom methods for handling object data.
- **Goal**: Gain a deeper understanding of how to design and interact with classes and objects, build constructors, and develop methods for specific tasks.

### 6. Combined Practice Tasks
- **Description**: Comprehensive tasks that integrate loops, `ArrayList`, inheritance, and class methods to solve more complex problems.
- **Goal**: Apply multiple OOP concepts together, enhancing problem-solving skills and reinforcing the ability to design robust Java programs.

## Purpose of This Repository
The exercises in this repository are created with the purpose of building a strong foundation in Java‚Äôs OOP capabilities. By practicing with loops, collections, inheritance, data validation, and class manipulation, this repository helps to deepen understanding of:
- Class structures and relationships.
- Object creation and manipulation.
- Effective use of loops for various scenarios.
- Managing collections with `ArrayList` for better data handling.
- Implementing inheritance to promote code reuse and extend functionality.
- Ensuring data integrity through validation techniques.

Stay tuned for more examples and comprehensive exercises as I progress with learning and mastering OOP concepts in Java.
