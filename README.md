# üßë‚Äçüíª Java Practice Repository

This repository contains various Java practice exercises focusing on core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The projects and exercises included here are designed to help reinforce understanding of OOP concepts such as loops, collections, inheritance, and practical application of these principles in Java.

## Overview of Projects and Exercises

### 1. Loops (Petlje)
- **Description**: Practice tasks involving different types of loops in Java, including `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
- **Goal**: Strengthen understanding of loop structures and their use cases in solving iterative problems.

### 2. ArrayList
- **Description**: Exercises focusing on the use of `ArrayList` for managing collections of objects and data.
- **Goal**: Develop familiarity with Java‚Äôs `ArrayList` class, including adding, removing, and iterating over elements.

### 3. Inheritance (Nasljeƒëivanje)
- **Description**: Examples and exercises demonstrating inheritance in Java, showcasing the use of parent and child classes, method overriding, and polymorphism.
- **Goal**: Understand the principles of inheritance, enabling the creation of more maintainable and scalable code through class hierarchies.

### 4. Combined Practice Tasks
- **Description**: Comprehensive tasks that integrate loops, `ArrayList`, and inheritance concepts to solve more complex problems.
- **Goal**: Apply multiple OOP concepts together, enhancing problem-solving skills and reinforcing the ability to design robust Java programs.

## Purpose of This Repository
The exercises in this repository are created with the purpose of building a strong foundation in Java‚Äôs OOP capabilities. By practicing with loops, collections, and inheritance, this repository helps to deepen understanding of:
- Class structures and relationships.
- Object creation and manipulation.
- Effective use of loops for various scenarios.
- Managing collections with `ArrayList` for better data handling.
- Implementing inheritance to promote code reuse and extend functionality.

Stay tuned for more examples and comprehensive exercises as I progress with learning and mastering OOP concepts in Java.
