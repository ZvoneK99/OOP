# OOP

Just uploaded my work from the past few days.  
Starting with learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.

This repository contains various beginner exercises and projects in Java as I explore OOP principles, including classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, and working with collections like ArrayLists.

## Projects

- **Petlje**: Practicing loops in Java.
- **Automobil**: Basic class structure, constructors, and methods.
- **Kino & Film**: Example projects focusing on classes and relationships between them.
- **NasljeÄ‘ivanje (Inheritance)**: Exercises to demonstrate inheritance, including parent and child classes with specialized methods and attributes.
- **ArrayList Examples**: Tasks that involve using ArrayLists for managing collections of objects and performing operations on them.

Stay tuned for more updates as I progress!
